To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

Define Class Structure: Create a class structure to represent classes and students. This class should have attributes like class name, maximum size, and a list to store enrolled students.

Implement Administrator Mode:
Allow administrators to add, update, and delete classes.
Provide functionality to print class rosters.

Implement Student Mode:
Allow students to enroll in classes.
Enable students to view their enrolled classes and un-enroll from them if needed.

Ensure Data Integrity:
Implement checks to ensure that the maximum class size is not exceeded when enrolling students.

Data Storage:
Decide on a method for storing class information and student enrollments. This could be done using files (e.g., CSV or text files) or databases.

Testing:
Test the system thoroughly to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.
Include both positive and negative test cases to validate the system's behavior in different scenarios.

Error Handling:
Implement error handling to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users when something goes wrong.

Documentation:
Document your code thoroughly to make it easier for others to understand and maintain.
By following these steps, you can create a robust registration system that meets the requirements outlined in the problem statement. 
Remember to iterate and refine your solution based on feedback and real-world usage to improve its usability and reliability.
